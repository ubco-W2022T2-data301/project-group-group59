## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

Collectively we have similar interests in using this data set, such that we both want to discover how the chemical contaminates effect the environment and contribute to the climate crisis in that area. Separately Aksay plans to determine if different nitrogenous oxides correlate to the production of acid rain or if there is any correlation at all. Furthermore, Brianna specifically is looking at if there is any parasitic regression between the different variables and to see if there is any correlation or not. Together we plan to take all the information collected from our separate analyses to determine if this affects the progression of the climate crisis in that area. 

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

Our dataset contains a single file containing information about different chemical  contaminants in the air, such as nitrogenous oxides, non-metanic hydrocarbons, average concentrations of carbon dioxide and benzenes. The data was collected daily over the span of a year through a multi sensor devices to monitor benzene levels near a city in Italy and it was collected by  ENEA - National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Economic Development. The original study used this data to detmine different benzene gas levels from a specific area that was considered to have a high amount of air polution.
