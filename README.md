## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

We are interested in this topic for a few reasons, the first being each data point and its significance towards the level of income. We hope to be able to accurately analyze the dataset to provide insightful information necessary to determine the significance of each data point in a manner that is easy to understand and manipulate to best provide information to the user. A specific question all three members are interested in and want to explore more is the impact of education level and its result on income. This is due to the large cultural push convincing a large majority of the population to pursue further education without providing any context or statistics on the return on investment. Due to the nature of this dataset, viewing the significance of each of the other metrics might provide us with a different view of the situation. As for a user-facing Dashboard, we believe that we could build one using this dataset.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The dataset we will be using for this project is an extraction of United States census data collected in 1994 completed by Ronny Kohavi and Barry Becker of Data Mining and Visualization Silicon Graphis. Within this dataset, there are many attributes that are used when collecting information on the demographic of a country's population. This includes, but is not limited to age, education level, sex, race, relationship status, and occupation. The data itself is collected over a multi-year period as the US population is very large, which in turn takes time to collect, compile, and publish. The purpose of census data is to help determine stakeholders which are then used when making decisions on a local, state, and federal level. The purpose of this extraction done by Ronny and Barry was to predict whether an adult's income will exceed $50K/yr based on the information collected via the US census. The census data itself is collected by the federal government which utilizes primary and secondary sources to provide the necessary information which is collected every 10 years. Methods of the collection include but are not limited to a mail survey, internet collection, and consolidation of state sources.
