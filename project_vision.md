## Interests

### Person 1 (Akshay Mahi):
 Air quality and the related pollutants is an important topic that has continued to generate conversation as the true impacts have continued to be demonstrated. Global warming has been shown to have detrimental impact in the modern day with the expectation of it only getting worse if changes are not made. The specific areas I am interested in is regarding NOx. NOx is shorthand for Nitrogen Oxides, specifically nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide, which are both factors of smog and acid rain which have impacts on wildlife and human populations.



### Person 2 (Brianna Chernenkoff):
My interest in the data set lies in understanding the overall relationship between different atmospheric contaminates and how it can effect the longevity of society based on health, vegetation growth and how it correlates to the increase in global warming issues within that specific geographic location.
