### Person 1 (Akshay Mahi):
I find census data quite interesting as viewing a population with a larger lens gives a viewpoint that is difficult to comprehend in any other mean but data. Within this data set, education level is something that I find interesting as it has become a more divided discussion whether post secondary increases living standards/wages. Marriage status is another interesting data point as in the modern day the number has been lowering, as a result, analyzing the data would provide interesting statistics within the discussion

### Person 2 (Nariman Milanfar):
I am interested in this dataset to capture each factor and its impact on the level of income. This reveals many social discussions around feminism or racial concerns. later on, I can have some words to engage these discussions with the knowledge I gain as proof from my project. moreover, this dataset can solve my personal concern about education level, age, and occupation variables needed for my future success. 

### Person 3 (Justice Ingleton):
I think adult income is an important facet of any society you might be a part of. Income or potential income helps to elucidate the general scheme of possibilities for people entering the workforce and is something people should pay more attention to, a company or country that has better social support will have a higher average income. Income is a primary influencing factor in the types of jobs people choose  or apply to (myself included), so I think having a better understanding of its spread, and factors that may contribute to significant differences, as well as how it breaks down in  society could be useful in itself. Finally, money breakdowns and the information that goes in to the distribution of wealth is one of my primary interests, so I think this data set will be useful and interesting to me personally. You know what they say, money makes the world go around.
